### Web Frameworks and Flask
This repository provides an introduction to web frameworks and a guide on how to build a web framework using Flask. It also covers topics such as defining routes, handling variables in routes, using templates to create HTML responses, and displaying data from a MySQL database in HTML.

### What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications. It provides a standard way to build and deploy web applications, and usually includes a set of libraries, tools, and conventions that make it easier to develop web applications.

### How to Build a Web Framework with Flask
Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications using Python. This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a web framework using Flask. It covers topics such as creating a Flask application, defining routes, using templates, and displaying data from a MySQL database.

### How to Define Routes in Flask
Routes are used in Flask to map URLs to Python functions. This section provides an overview of how to define routes in Flask, including the use of variable rules to handle dynamic URLs.

### What is a Route?
A route is a URL pattern that is mapped to a Python function in a web application. When a user visits a URL that matches a route, Flask calls the corresponding Python function to handle the request.

### How to Handle Variables in a Route
Flask allows you to handle dynamic URLs by using variable rules in routes. This section provides an overview of how to handle variables in a route using Flask, including the use of variable converters to specify the data type of the variable.

### What is a Template?
A template is a file that contains HTML code and placeholders for dynamic content. Flask uses templates to generate HTML responses for web applications. This section provides an overview of how to use templates in Flask, including the use of Jinja2, a popular template engine for Python.

### How to Create an HTML Response in Flask by Using a Template
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to use templates to create HTML responses in Flask. It covers topics such as creating a template file, rendering the template in a Flask view function, and passing data to the template.

### How to Create a Dynamic Template (Loops, Conditions...)
Flask allows you to create dynamic templates by using loops and conditions. This section provides an overview of how to create dynamic templates in Flask using Jinja2.

### How to Display Data from a MySQL Database in HTML
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to display data from a MySQL database in HTML using Flask. It covers topics such as connecting to a MySQL database, querying data from the database, and passing the data to a template to be displayed in HTML.

### Conclusion
This repository provides an introduction to web frameworks and a guide on how to build a web framework using Flask. It covers topics such as defining routes, handling variables in routes, using templates to create HTML responses, and displaying data from a MySQL database in HTML. We hope that this guide helps you to get started with Flask and building web applications.
